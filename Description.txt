Description and changes.

I made this site using a template by the name of Verticard Template from
https://templatemo.com/tm-533-verticard.

I've downloaded the template and edited many parts of its code. 
The changes I've made are :
1. Addition of a new page called "projects"
2. Removing the form from the "Contact" page and adding a link to my linkedIn profile.
3. Modifying an already given page ( given by templatemo when i downloaded the template ) into a page by the name
of "Travel" and editing its contents to my liking.
4. Changing the content in all pages according to my content blueprint.
5. Edited some of the css code to get precise results.

Images in the "Extras" page come with a design where a text appears on them when a mouse hovers on them.

Validations.

There are a total of 2 warnings at the end of all the validation results. 
They do not interfere with any of the site's workings and all the pages work perfectly fine in both mobile and 
laptop/desktop view.

The { Extras }.

There's a sticky footer and a carousel in my site.
